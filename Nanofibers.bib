@article{sondergaard_general_2001,
	Abstract = {A model for spontaneous emission in active dielectric microstructures is given in terms of the classical electric field Green's tensor and the quantum-mechanical operators for the generating currents. A formalism is given for calculating the Green's tensor, which does not rely on the existence of a complete power orthogonal set of electromagnetic modes, and the formalism may therefore be applied to microstructures with gain and/or absorption. The Green's tensor is calculated for an optical fiber amplifier, and the spontaneous emission in fiber amplifiers is studied with respect to the position, transition frequency, and vector orientation of a spatially localized current source. Radiation patterns are studied using a Poynting vector approach taking into account amplification or absorption from an active medium in the fiber.},

	Abstract = {We experimentally realize a Fabry--Perot-type optical microresonator near the cesium D2 line wavelength based on a tapered optical fiber, equipped with two fiber Bragg gratings that enclose a subwavelength diameter waist. Owing to the very low taper losses, the finesse of the resonator reaches F=86 while the on-resonance transmission is T=11\%. The characteristics of our resonator fulfill the requirements of nonlinear optics and cavity quantum electrodynamics in the strong coupling regime. These characteristics, combined with the demonstrated ease of use and advantageous mode geometry, open a realm of applications.},

	Abstract = {The spin of light in subwavelength-diameter waveguides can be orthogonal to the propagation direction of the photons because of the strong transverse confinement. This transverse spin changes sign when the direction of propagation is reversed. Using this effect, we demonstrate the directional spontaneous emission of photons by laser-trapped caesium atoms into an optical nanofibre and control their propagation direction by the excited state of the atomic emitters. In particular, we tune the spontaneous emission into the counter-propagating guided modes from symmetric to strongly asymmetric, where more than \% of the optical power is launched into one or the other direction. We expect our results to have important implications for research in quantum nanophotonics and for implementations of integrated optical signal processing in the quantum regime.},

We show that the confinement of the guided modes and the degeneracy of the excited and ground states substantially affect the spontaneous emission process. We demonstrate that different magnetic sublevels have different decay rates. When the fiber radius is about 200nm, a significant fraction (up to 28\%) of spontaneous emission by the atom can be channeled into guided modes. Our results may find applications for developing nanoprobes for atoms and efficient couplers for subwavelength-diameter fibers.},

@article{deutsch_photonic_1995,
	Abstract = {We study photonic band gaps in a one-dimensional optical lattice of laser-cooled trapped atoms. We solve for the self-consistent equilibrium positions of the atoms, accounting for the backaction of the atoms on the trapping beams. This solution depends strongly on the sign of the trapping laser detuning. For red-detuned trapping lasers, the resulting lattice exhibits a one-dimensional photonic band gap for frequencies between the trapping laser frequency and the atomic resonance. For blue detuning the stop band extends symmetrically about resonance, typically for hundreds of atomic linewidths, except for the small region between atomic resonance and the lattice frequency, which is excluded. We calculate the reflection spectrum for a lattice of Cs atoms for various trapping laser detunings and interpret its behavior as a function of the lattice size and density. For a mean density of 1011 cm−3, and 1000 planes, 55\% reflection of a weak probe beam should be observed. We also consider Bragg scattering in a three-dimensional optical lattice as a means of probing the long-range order in the atomic density correlation function.},

This method relies on the azimuthally asymmetric coupling of the ensemble with the evanescent field of an off-resonant probe beam, transmitted through the nanofiber. The resulting birefringence and dispersion are significant; we observe a phase shift per atom of ∼1 mrad at a detuning of 6 times the natural linewidth, corresponding to an effective resonant optical density per atom of 0.027. Moreover, we utilize this strong dispersion to nondestructively determine the number of atoms.},

By fabricating the PCW with a band edge near the D\$\_1\$ transition of atomic cesium, strong interaction is achieved between trapped atoms and guided-mode photons.

Reaching this goal requires surmounting diverse challenges in nanofabrication and atomic manipulation. Here we report the development of a novel integrated optical circuit with a photonic crystal capable of both localizing and interfacing atoms with guided photons. Optical bands of a photonic crystal waveguide are aligned with selected atomic transitions. From reflection spectra measured with average atom number , we infer that atoms are localized within the waveguide by optical dipole forces. The fraction of single-atom radiative decay into the waveguide is Γ1D/Γ′≃(0.32$\pm$0.08), where Γ1D is the rate of emission into the guided mode and Γ′ is the decay rate into all other channels. Γ1D/Γ′ is unprecedented in all current atom--photon interfaces.},

We analyze all possible dipole orientations and nanowire radii in the range from very small to comparable to the wavelength. Our theoretical approach is based on the Fourier transform technique and equivalent to the construction of Green's function for a dipole at an arbitrary location inside the nanowire. We show that the total emitted power can exhibit rather pronounced oscillations as a function of the frequency and radius. The far-field pattern is also very sensitive to the frequency and radius, especially in the regime when leaky (or whispering gallery) modes with finite axial wave numbers are excited. We discuss the enhancement of emission into guided modes due to formation of Fabry-P{\'e}rot cavity in a finite length nanowire. Our results yield directly the extraction efficiencies and angular distribution of radiation of light-emitting diodes made of nanowires.},

In order to further increase the performance and fidelities achieved in these protocols, a deeper understanding of the relevant noise and decoherence processes needs to be gained. In this paper, we provide for the first time a complete description of the decoherence from spontaneous emission. We derive from first principles the effects of photons being spontaneously emitted into unobserved modes. Our results relate the resulting decay and noise terms in effective equations of motion for collective atomic spins and the forward-propagating light modes to the full atomic level structure. We illustrate and apply our results to the case of a quantum memory protocol. Our results can be applied to any alkali atoms, and the general approach taken in this paper can be applied to light--matter interfaces and quantum memories based on different mechanisms.},

Fortunately, it is still possible to investigate a many-particle entanglement when the state of the system possesses sufficient symmetry. In this paper, we present a practical method for efficiently computing various bipartite entanglement measures for states in the symmetric subspace and perform these calculations for N∼103. By considering all possible bipartite splits, we construct a picture of the multiscale entanglement in large symmetric systems. In particular, we characterize dynamically generated spin-squeezed states by comparing them to known reference states (e.g., Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states), and families of states with near-maximal bipartite entropy. We quantify the trade-off between the degree of entanglement and its robustness to particle loss, emphasizing that substantial entanglement need not be fragile.},

@article{lacroute_state-insensitive_2012,
	Abstract = {Laser trapping and interfacing of laser-cooled atoms in an optical fiber network is an important tool for quantum information science. Following the pioneering work of Balykin et al (2004 Phys. Rev. A 70 011401) and Vetsch et al (2010 Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 203603), we propose a robust method for trapping single cesium atoms with a two-color state-insensitive evanescent wave around a dielectric nanofiber. Specifically, we show that vector light shifts (i.e. effective inhomogeneous Zeeman broadening of the ground states) induced by the inherent ellipticity of the forward-propagating evanescent wave can be effectively canceled by a backward-propagating evanescent wave. Furthermore, by operating the trapping lasers at the magic wavelengths, we remove the differential scalar light shift between ground and excited states, thereby allowing for resonant driving of the optical D2 transition. This scheme provides a promising approach to trap and probe neutral atoms with long trap and coherence lifetimes with realistic experimental parameters.},

We obtain simple analytical expressions for the total intensity of the electric field. We discuss the origin of the deviations of the exact fundamental mode HE11 from the approximate mode LP01. We show that the thin thickness of the fiber and the high contrast between the refractive indices of the silica core and the vacuum-clad substantially modify the intensity distributions and the polarization properties of the field and its components, especially in the vicinity of the fiber surface. One of the promising applications of the field around the subwavelength-diameter fiber is trapping and guiding of atoms by the optical force of the evanescent field.},

@article{deutsch_quantum_2010,
	Abstract = {Quantum control and measurement are two sides of the same coin. To affect a dynamical map, well-designed time-dependent control fields must be applied to the system of interest. To read out the quantum state, information about the system must be transferred to a probe field. We study a particular example of this dual action in the context of quantum control and measurement of atomic spins through the light-shift interaction with an off-resonant optical probe. By introducing an irreducible tensor decomposition, we identify the coupling of the Stokes vector of the light field with moments of the atomic spin state. This shows how polarization spectroscopy can be used for continuous weak measurement of atomic observables that evolve as a function of time. Simultaneously, the state-dependent light shift induced by the probe field can drive nonlinear dynamics of the spin, and can be used to generate arbitrary unitary transformations on the atoms. We revisit the derivation of the master equation in order to give a unified description of spin dynamics in the presence of both nonlinear dynamics and photon scattering. Based on this formalism, we review applications to quantum control, including the design of state-to-state mappings, and quantum-state reconstruction via continuous weak measurement on a dynamically controlled ensemble.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the quantum fluctuations of the fields associated with a broad class of optical scattering and transmission problems by developing the quantum electrodynamics of an idealized linear, but nonuniform, dielectric medium. We present and compare two quantization schemes for this purpose. The first is based on the expansion of the field in terms of a set of single-frequency solutions of the Maxwell equations. The second involves expanding the field in the set of plane-wave solutions of the Maxwell equations in the vacuum. The relation between the two quantization schemes is discussed in the framework of the scattering theory that connects them. The methods presented are used to show that various field components within a dielectric medium may be either superfluctuant or subfluctuant relative to their fundamental uncertainties in the vacuum. These alterations of the fluctuation properties of the fields are shown to lead to changes in the spontaneous emission rates for both electric and magnetic dipole transitions of excited atoms within or near dielectric media. We also analyze the quantum properties of the transition radiation emitted by a fast charged particle in passing from one dielectric medium to another.},

We adopt such a classical picture of a radiating dipole oscillator to derive explicit expressions for the coupling of single atoms and atomic ensembles to Gaussian modes in free space and in an optical resonator. The cooperativity parameter of cavity QED is shown to play a central role and is given a geometrical interpretation. The classical analysis yields transparent, intuitive results that are useful for analyzing applications of cavity QED such as atom detection and counting, cavity cooling, cavity spin squeezing, cavity spin optomechanics, or phase transitions associated with the self-organization of the ensemble-light system.},

	Abstract = {A strongly confined light field necessarily exhibits a local polarization that varies on a subwavelength scale. We demonstrate that a single optical mode of this kind can be used to selectively and simultaneously manipulate atomic ensembles that are less than a micron away from each other and equally coupled to the light field. The technique is implemented with an optical nanofiber that provides an evanescent field interface between a strongly guided optical mode and two diametric linear arrays of cesium atoms. Using this single optical mode, the two atomic ensembles can simultaneously be optically pumped to opposite Zeeman states. Moreover, the state-dependent light shifts can be made locally distinct, thereby enabling an independent coherent manipulation of the two ensembles. Our results open a route toward advanced manipulation of atomic samples in nanoscale quantum optics systems.},

We show that the rate of scattering of guided light from the atom in the steady-state regime into the guided modes is asymmetric with respect to the forward and backward directions and depends on the polarization of the probe field. The asymmetry between the forward and backward scattering is a result of the complex transition structure of the atom and the existence of a longitudinal component of the guided-mode profile function. In the case of a two-level atom, the rates of spontaneous emission (and consequently the rates of scattering) into the forward and backward guided modes differ from each other when the atomic dipole matrix-element vector is a complex vector in the plane that contains the fiber axis and the atomic position.},

	Abstract = {We study the propagation of nanofiber-guided light through an array of atomic cesium, taking into account the transitions between the hyperfine levels 6S1/2F=4 and 6P3/2F′=5 of the D2 line. We derive the coupled-mode propagation equation, the input-output equation, the scattering matrix, the transfer matrix, and the reflection and transmission coefficients for the guided field in the linear, quasistationary, weak-excitation regime. We show that, when the initial distribution of populations of atomic ground-state sublevels is independent of the magnetic quantum number, the quasilinear polarizations along the principal axes x and y, which are parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the radial direction of the atomic position, are not coupled to each other in the linear coherent scattering process. When the guided probe field is quasilinearly polarized along the major principal axis x, forward and backward scattering have different characteristics. We find that, when the array period is far from the Bragg resonance, the backward scattering is weak. Under the Bragg resonance, most of the guided probe light can be reflected back in a broad region of field detunings even though there is an irreversible decay channel into radiation modes. When the atom number is large enough, two different band gaps may be formed, whose properties depend on the polarization of the guided probe field.},

@article{wubs_multiple-scattering_2004,
	Abstract = {The dynamics of a collection of resonant atoms embedded inside an inhomogeneous nondispersive and lossless dielectric is described with a dipole Hamiltonian that is based on a canonical quantization theory. The dielectric is described macroscopically by a position-dependent dielectric function and the atoms as microscopic harmonic oscillators. We identify and discuss the role of several types of Green tensors that describe the spatio-temporal propagation of field operators. After integrating out the atomic degrees of freedom, a multiple-scattering formalism emerges in which an exact Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the electric field operator plays a central role. The equation describes atoms as point sources and point scatterers for light. First, single-atom properties are calculated such as position-dependent spontaneous-emission rates as well as differential cross sections for elastic scattering and for resonance fluorescence. Secondly, multiatom processes are studied. It is shown that the medium modifies both the resonant and the static parts of the dipole-dipole interactions. These interatomic interactions may cause the atoms to scatter and emit light cooperatively. Unlike in free space, differences in position-dependent emission rates and radiative line shifts influence cooperative decay in the dielectric. As a generic example, it is shown that near a partially reflecting plane there is a sharp transition from two-atom superradiance to single-atom emission as the atomic positions are varied.},

For a transverse mode size of the order of λ2, we find nonlinear behavior for a few photons already, or even for a single photon.

It is shown that minimal and multipolar coupling lead to essentially the same lowest-order perturbative result for the force acting on an atom in an energy eigenstate. To go beyond perturbation theory, the calculations are based on the exact center-of-mass equation of motion. For a nondriven atom in the weak-coupling regime, the force as a function of time is a superposition of force components that are related to the electronic density matrix elements at a chosen time. Even the force component associated with the ground state is not derivable from a potential in the ususal way, because of the position dependence of the atomic polarizability. Further, when the atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of energy eigenstates, then temporally oscillating force components are observed, which are due to the interaction of the atom with both electric and magnetic fields.},

	Abstract = {We develop a formulation of quantum damping theory in which the explicit nature of inputs from a heat bath, and of outputs into it, is taken into account. Quantum Langevin equations are developed, in which the Langevin forces are the field operators corresponding to the input modes. Time-reversed equations exist in which the Langevin forces are the output modes, and the sign of damping is reversed. Causality and boundary conditions relating inputs to system variables are developed. The concept of ``quantum white noise'' is formulated, and the formal relationship between quantum Langevin equations and quantum stochastic differential equations (SDE's) is established. In analogy to the classical formulation, there are two kinds of SDE's: the Ito and the Stratonovich forms. Rules are developed for converting from one to the other. These rules depend on the nature of the quantum white noise, which may be squeezed. The SDE's developed are shown to be exactly equivalent to quantum master equations, and rules are developed for computing multitime-ordered correlation functions with use of the appropriate master equation. With use of the causality and boundary conditions, the relationship between correlation functions of the output and those of the system and the input is developed. It is possible to calculate what kind of output statistics result, provided that one knows the input statistics and provided that one can compute the system correlation functions.},

	Abstract = {The linear Faraday effect is used to implement a continuous measurement of the spin of a sample of laser-cooled atoms trapped in an optical lattice. One of the optical lattice beams serves also as a probe beam, thereby allowing one to monitor the atomic dynamics in real time and with minimal perturbation. A simple theory is developed to predict the measurement sensitivity and associated cost in terms of decoherence caused by the scattering of probe photons. Calculated signal-to-noise ratios in measurements of Larmor precession are found to agree with experimental data for a wide range of lattice intensity and detuning. Finally, quantum back-action is estimated by comparing the measurement sensitivity to spin projection noise, and shown to be insignificant in the current experiment. A continuous quantum measurement based on Faraday spectroscopy in optical lattices may open up new possibilities for the study of quantum feedback and classically chaotic quantum systems.},

Special attention is paid to the case when the cylinder radius is small in comparison with radiation wavelength (nanofiber or photonic wire). In this case, the analytical expressions of the transition rates for different orientations of a dipole are derived. It is shown that the main contribution to decay rates is due to the quasistatic interaction of the atom dipole momentum with the nanofiber, and the contributions of guided modes are exponentially small. On the contrary, in the case when the radius of the fiber is only slightly less than the radiation wavelength, the influence of guided modes can be substantial. The results obtained are compared with the case of a dielectric nanospheroid and an ideally conducting wire.},

@article{chen_finite-element_2010,
	Abstract = {We develop a self-consistent finite-element method to quantitatively study spontaneous emission from emitters in nanoscale proximity of plasmonic waveguides. In the model, it is assumed that only one guided mode is dominatingly excited by the quantum emitter, while the cross section of the plasmonic waveguide can be arbitrary. The fraction of the energy coupled to the plasmonic mode can be calculated exactly, which can be used to determine the efficiency with which single optical plasmons are generated. We apply our numerical method to calculate the coupling of a quantum emitter to a cylindrical metallic nanowire and a square metallic waveguide, and compare the cylindrical metallic nanowire with previous work that employs quasistatic approximation. For the cylindrical metallic nanowire we observe good agreement with the quasistatic approximation for radii below 10 nm, but for increasing radius the spontaneous emission β factor and the plasmonic decay rate deviate substantially, by factors of up to 5--10 for a radius of ∼100 nm, from the values obtained in the quasistatic approximation. We also show that the quasistatic approximation is typically valid when the radius is less than the skin depth of the metals at optical frequencies. For the square metallic waveguide we estimate an optimized value for the spontaneous emission β factor up to 80\%.},

The mode excitation efficiency is examined for three higher-order modes TE01, TM01 and HE21 and compared with the excitation efficiency for the fundamental fiber mode HE11. It is shown that pumping rates for the higher-order modes of an optical nanofiber are generally 5--10 times higher than that for the fundamental mode.

When an atom is located on the axis of the cylindrical hollow, we obtain analytic expressions of the atomic level shifts in two limiting cases: when b (radius of hollow) is very small, the level shift is proportional to b−2 which is associated with the kinetic-energy change of the atomic electron, whereas when b is very large, the shift is proportional to b−4 which is identified as the retarded (Casimir-Polder) interaction energy. Moreover, we calculate the atomic potentials as a function of the position of atoms in the hollow region, which is important for the atom-guiding experiment. We also calculate the decay rates and find enhanced rates inside and outside the cylinder. In particular, we compare the radiative properties of an atom inside the hollow cylinder with those between two plates, and those near a cylinder with near a single surface.},

The theory is applied to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom at the center of a three-layered spherical cavity, with the cavity wall being modeled by a band-gap dielectric of Lorentz type. Both weak and strong coupling are studied, the latter with a special emphasis on cases where the atomic transition is (i) in the normal-dispersion zone near the medium resonance, and (ii) in the anomalous-dispersion zone associated with the band gap.

Phenomena due to the presence of losses in the metal are discussed. In case of two atoms, we observe Dicke subradiance and superradiance resulting from their plasmon-mediated interaction.

Using a realistic loss factor of γ/2π=2 THz, Purcell factors of approximately 250 and 100 are found at optical frequencies for p-polarized and s-polarized dipoles, respectively, placed 28 nm (0.02λ0) above the slab surface. For smaller loss values, we demonstrate that the slow-light regime of odd metamaterial waveguide propagation modes can be observed and related to distinct resonances in the Purcell factors. Correspondingly, we predict unusually large and rich Lamb shifts of approximately −1 to −6 GHz for a dipole moment of 50 Debye. We also make a direct calculation of the far-field-emission spectra which contains direct measurable access to these enhanced Purcell factors and Lamb shifts.},

@article{baragiola_three-dimensional_2014,
	Abstract = {We study the three-dimensional nature of the quantum interface between an ensemble of cold, trapped atomic spins and a paraxial laser beam, coupled through a dispersive interaction. To achieve strong entanglement between the collective atomic spin and the photons, one must match the spatial mode of the collective radiation of the ensemble with the mode of the laser beam while minimizing the effects of decoherence due to optical pumping. For ensembles coupling to a probe field that varies over the extent of the cloud, the set of atoms that indistinguishably radiates into a desired mode of the field defines an inhomogeneous spin wave. Strong coupling of a spin wave to the probe mode is not characterized by a single parameter, the optical density, but by a collection of different effective atom numbers that characterize the coherence and decoherence of the system. To model the dynamics of the system, we develop a full stochastic master equation, including coherent collective scattering into paraxial modes, decoherence by local inhomogeneous diffuse scattering, and backaction due to continuous measurement of the light entangled with the spin waves. This formalism is used to study the squeezing of a spin wave via continuous quantum nondemolition measurement. We find that the greatest squeezing occurs in parameter regimes where spatial inhomogeneities are significant, far from the limit in which the interface is well approximated by a one-dimensional, homogeneous model.},

	Abstract = {Optimally extracting information from measurements performed on a physical system requires an accurate model of the measurement interaction. Continuously probing the collective spin of an alkali-metal atom cloud via its interaction with an off-resonant optical probe is an important example of such a measurement where realistic modeling at the quantum level is possible using standard techniques from atomic physics. Typically, however, tutorial descriptions of this technique have neglected the multilevel structure of realistic atoms for the sake of simplification. We account for the full multilevel structure of alkali-metal atoms and derive the irreducible form of the polarizability Hamiltonian describing a typical dispersive quantum measurement. For a specific set of parameters, we then show that semiclassical predictions of the theory are consistent with our experimental observations of polarization scattering by a polarized cloud of laser-cooled cesium atoms. We also derive the signal-to-noise ratio under a single-measurement trial and use this to predict the rate of spin squeezing with multilevel alkali-metal atoms for arbitrary detuning of the probe beam.},

	Abstract = {During the past decade the interaction of light with multiatom ensembles has attracted much attention as a basic building block for quantum information processing and quantum state engineering. The field started with the realization that optically thick free space ensembles can be efficiently interfaced with quantum optical fields. By now the atomic ensemble-light interfaces have become a powerful alternative to the cavity-enhanced interaction of light with single atoms. Various mechanisms used for the quantum interface are discussed, including quantum nondemolition or Faraday interaction, quantum measurement and feedback, Raman interaction, photon echo, and electromagnetically induced transparency. This review provides a common theoretical frame for these processes, describes basic experimental techniques and media used for quantum interfaces, and reviews several key experiments on quantum memory for light, quantum entanglement between atomic ensembles and light, and quantum teleportation with atomic ensembles. The two types of quantum measurements which are most important for the interface are discussed: homodyne detection and photon counting. This review concludes with an outlook on the future of atomic ensembles as an enabling technology in quantum information processing.},

	Abstract = {We study quantum tomography based on a stochastic continuous-time measurement record obtained from a probe field collectively interacting with an ensemble of identically prepared systems. In comparison to previous studies, we consider here the case in which the measurement-induced backaction has a non-negligible effect on the dynamical evolution of the ensemble. We formulate a maximum likelihood estimate for the initial quantum state given only a single instance of the continuous diffusive measurement record. We apply our estimator to the simplest problem: state tomography of a single pure qubit, which, during the course of the measurement, is also subjected to dynamical control. We identify a regime where the many-body system is well approximated at all times by a separable pure spin coherent state, whose Bloch vector undergoes a conditional stochastic evolution. We simulate the results of our estimator and show that we can achieve close to the upper bound of fidelity set by the optimal generalized measurement. This estimate is compared to, and significantly outperforms, an equivalent estimator that ignores measurement backaction.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews quantum spin squeezing, which characterizes the sensitivity of a state with respect to SU(2) rotations, and is significant for both entanglement detection and high-precision metrology. We first present various definitions of spin squeezing parameters, explain their origin and properties for typical states, and then discuss spin-squeezed states produced with nonlinear twisting Hamiltonians. Afterward, we explain pairwise correlations and entanglement in spin-squeezed states, as well as the relations between spin squeezing and quantum Fisher information, where the latter plays a central role in quantum metrology. We also review the applications of spin squeezing for detecting quantum chaos and quantum phase transitions, as well as the influence of decoherence on spin squeezing. Finally, we review several experimental realizations of spin squeezing, as well as their corresponding theoretical backgrounds, including: producing spin-squeezed states via particle collisions in Bose--Einstein condensates, transferring photon squeezing to atomic ensembles, and generating spin squeezing via quantum non-demolition measurements.},

Since Yb171 atoms have only a nuclear spin of one-half in the ground state, the system constitutes the simplest spin ensemble and is thus robust against decoherence.

@article{bohnet_reduced_2014,
	Abstract = {Fundamental quantum noise limits the precision of quantum-based detectors, for example limiting the ultimate precision of atomic clocks, which have applications in communication, navigation and tests of fundamental physics. Collective measurements of many quantum spins can project the ensemble into an entangled, spin-squeezed state with improved quantum-limited measurement resolution. However, measurement back-action has limited previous implementations of collective measurements to only modest observed enhancements in precision. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a collective measurement with reduced measurement back-action to produce and directly observe, with no background subtraction, a spin-squeezed state with phase resolution improved by a factor of 10.5(1.5) in variance, or 10.2(6) dB, compared to the initially unentangled ensemble of N = 4.8 × 105 87Rb atoms. The measurement uses a cavity-enhanced probe of an optical cycling transition, mitigating back-action associated with state-changing transitions induced by the probe. This work establishes collective measurements as a powerful technique for generating useful entanglement for precision measurements.},

Phys. 14 093012). While canonical variables such as quadratures of the radiation field can be squeezed in at most one component, simultaneous squeezing in two orthogonal spin components can be achieved due to the angular momentum commutation relations. We present a novel scheme for planar squeezing via quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements in spin-1 systems. The QND measurement is achieved via near-resonant paramagnetic Faraday rotation probing, and the planar squeezing is obtained by sequential QND measurement of two orthogonal spin components. We compute the achievable squeezing for a variety of optical depths, initial conditions and probing strategies. The planar squeezed states generated in this way contain entanglement detectable by spin-squeezing inequalities and give an advantage relative to non-squeezed states for any precession phase angle, a benefit for single-shot and high-bandwidth magnetometry.},

Here, we use an optical nanofiber embedded in a cloud of laser-cooled 87Rb for near-infrared frequency upconversion via a resonant two-photon process. Sub-nW powers of the two-photon beams, at 780 nm and 776 nm, co-propagate through the optical nanofiber and generation of 420 nm photons is observed. A measurement of the Autler-Townes splitting provides a direct measurement of the Rabi frequency of the 780 nm transition. Through this method, dephasings of the system can be studied.

	Abstract = {We present a procedure for reproducibly fabricating ultrahigh transmission optical nanofibers (530 nm diameter and 84 mm stretch) with single-mode transmissions of 99.95 $\pm$ 0.02\%, which represents a loss from tapering of 2.6 × 10−5 dB/mm when normalized to the entire stretch. When controllably launching the next family of higher-order modes on a fiber with 195 mm stretch, we achieve a transmission of 97.8 $\pm$ 2.8\%, which has a loss from tapering of 5.0 × 10−4 dB/mm when normalized to the entire stretch. Our pulling and transfer procedures allow us to fabricate optical nanofibers that transmit more than 400 mW in high vacuum conditions. These results, published as parameters in our previous work, present an improvement of two orders of magnitude less loss for the fundamental mode and an increase in transmission of more than 300\% for higher-order modes, when following the protocols detailed in this paper. We extract from the transmission during the pull, the only reported spectrogram of a fundamental mode launch that does not include excitation to asymmetric modes; in stark contrast to a pull in which our cleaning protocol is not followed. These results depend critically on the pre-pull cleanliness and when properly following our pulling protocols are in excellent agreement with simulations.},

	Abstract = {We report the experimental observation of slow-light and coherent storage in a setting where light is tightly confined in the transverse directions. By interfacing a tapered optical nanofiber with a cold atomic ensemble, electromagnetically induced transparency is observed and light pulses at the single-photon level are stored in and retrieved from the atomic medium. The decay of efficiency with storage time is also measured and related to concurrent decoherence mechanisms. Collapses and revivals can be additionally controlled by an applied magnetic field. Our results based on subdiffraction-limited optical mode interacting with atoms via the strong evanescent field demonstrate an alternative to free-space focusing and a novel capability for information storage in an all-fibered quantum network.},

@article{kumar_interaction_2015,
	Abstract = {Optical nanofibres are used to confine light to sub-wavelength regions and are very promising tools for the development of optical fibre-based quantum networks using cold, neutral atoms. To date, experimental studies on atoms near nanofibres have focussed on fundamental fibre mode interactions. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of a few-mode optical nanofibre into a magneto-optical trap for 87Rb atoms. The nanofibre, with a waist diameter of ∼700 nm, supports both the fundamental and first group of higher order modes (HOMs) and is used for atomic fluorescence and absorption studies. In general, light propagating in higher order fibre modes has a greater evanescent field extension around the waist in comparison with the fundamental mode. By exploiting this behaviour, we demonstrate that the detected signal of fluorescent photons emitted from a cloud of cold atoms centred at the nanofibre waist is larger if HOMs are also included. In particular, the signal from HOMs appears to be about six times larger than that obtained for the fundamental mode. Absorption of on-resonance, HOM probe light by the laser-cooled atoms is also observed. These advances should facilitate the realization of atom trapping schemes based on HOM interference.},

	Abstract = {We study the spontaneous emission of an excited atom close to an optical nanofiber and the resulting scattering forces. For a suitably chosen orientation of the atomic dipole, the spontaneous emission pattern becomes asymmetric and a resonant Casimir--Polder force parallel to the fiber axis arises. For a simple model case, we show that the such a lateral force is due to the interaction of the circularly oscillating atomic dipole moment with its image inside the material. With the Casimir--Polder energy being constant in the lateral direction, the predicted lateral force does not derive from a potential in the usual way. Our results have implications for optical force measurements on a substrate as well as for laser cooling of atoms in nanophotonic traps.},

@article{madsen_spin_2004,
	Abstract = {We consider an ensemble of trapped atoms interacting with a continuous-wave laser field. For sufficiently polarized atoms and for a polarized light field, we may approximate the nonclassical components of the collective spin angular momentum operator for the atoms and the Stokes vectors of the field by effective position and momentum variables for which we assume a Gaussian state. Within this approximation, we present a theory for the squeezing of the atomic spin by polarization rotation measurements on the probe light. We derive analytical expressions for the squeezing with and without inclusion of the noise effects introduced by atomic decay and by photon absorption. The theory is readily adapted to the case of inhomogeneous light-atom coupling [A. Kuzmich and T.A.B. Kennedy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 030407 (2004)]. As a special case, we show how to formulate the theory for an optically thick sample by slicing the gas into pieces, each having only small photon absorption probability. Our analysis of a realistic probing and measurement scheme shows that it is the maximally squeezed component of the atomic gas that determines the accuracy of the measurement.},
