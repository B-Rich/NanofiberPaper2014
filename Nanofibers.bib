	abstract = {The spin of light in subwavelength-diameter waveguides can be orthogonal to the propagation direction of the photons because of the strong transverse confinement. This transverse spin changes sign when the direction of propagation is reversed. Using this effect, we demonstrate the directional spontaneous emission of photons by laser-trapped caesium atoms into an optical nanofibre and control their propagation direction by the excited state of the atomic emitters. In particular, we tune the spontaneous emission into the counter-propagating guided modes from symmetric to strongly asymmetric, where more than \% of the optical power is launched into one or the other direction. We expect our results to have important implications for research in quantum nanophotonics and for implementations of integrated optical signal processing in the quantum regime.},

A mesoscopic ensemble containing a few thousand atoms is trapped in the evanescent field of a nanofiber.

Strong coupling of the evanescent probe guided by the nanofiber allows for a real-time measurement with a precision of ±8 atoms on an ensemble of some 103 atoms in a one-dimensional trap.

We solve for the self-consistent equilibrium positions of the atoms, accounting for the backaction of the atoms on the trapping beams. This solution depends strongly on the sign of the trapping laser detuning. For red-detuned trapping lasers, the resulting lattice exhibits a one-dimensional photonic band gap for frequencies between the trapping laser frequency and the atomic resonance. For blue detuning the stop band extends symmetrically about resonance, typically for hundreds of atomic linewidths, except for the small region between atomic resonance and the lattice frequency, which is excluded. We calculate the reflection spectrum for a lattice of Cs atoms for various trapping laser detunings and interpret its behavior as a function of the lattice size and density. For a mean density of 1011 cm−3, and 1000 planes, 55\% reflection of a weak probe beam should be observed.

Optical bands of a photonic crystal waveguide are aligned with selected atomic transitions. From reflection spectra measured with average atom number , we infer that atoms are localized within the waveguide by optical dipole forces.

When an atom is located on the axis of the cylindrical hollow, we obtain analytic expressions of the atomic level shifts in two limiting cases: when b (radius of hollow) is very small, the level shift is proportional to b−2 which is associated with the kinetic-energy change of the atomic electron, whereas when b is very large, the shift is proportional to b−4 which is identified as the retarded (Casimir-Polder) interaction energy. Moreover, we calculate the atomic potentials as a function of the position of atoms in the hollow region, which is important for the atom-guiding experiment.

	abstract = {Laser trapping and interfacing of laser-cooled atoms in an optical fiber network is an important tool for quantum information science. Following the pioneering work of Balykin et al (2004 Phys. Rev. A 70 011401) and Vetsch et al (2010 Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 203603), we propose a robust method for trapping single cesium atoms with a two-color state-insensitive evanescent wave around a dielectric nanofiber. Specifically, we show that vector light shifts (i.e. effective inhomogeneous Zeeman broadening of the ground states) induced by the inherent ellipticity of the forward-propagating evanescent wave can be effectively canceled by a backward-propagating evanescent wave. Furthermore, by operating the trapping lasers at the magic wavelengths, we remove the differential scalar light shift between ground and excited states, thereby allowing for resonant driving of the optical D2 transition. This scheme provides a promising approach to trap and probe neutral atoms with long trap and coherence lifetimes with realistic experimental parameters.},

To read out the quantum state, information about the system must be transferred to a probe field. We study a particular example of this dual action in the context of quantum control and measurement of atomic spins through the light-shift interaction with an off-resonant optical probe. By introducing an irreducible tensor decomposition, we identify the coupling of the Stokes vector of the light field with moments of the atomic spin state. This shows how polarization spectroscopy can be used for continuous weak measurement of atomic observables that evolve as a function of time. Simultaneously, the state-dependent light shift induced by the probe field can drive nonlinear dynamics of the spin, and can be used to generate arbitrary unitary transformations on the atoms. We revisit the derivation of the master equation in order to give a unified description of spin dynamics in the presence of both nonlinear dynamics and photon scattering. Based on this formalism, we review applications to quantum control, including the design of state-to-state mappings, and quantum-state reconstruction via continuous weak measurement on a dynamically controlled ensemble.},

	abstract = {We study the three-dimensional nature of the quantum interface between an ensemble of cold, trapped atomic spins and a paraxial laser beam, coupled through a dispersive interaction. To achieve strong entanglement between the collective atomic spin and the photons, one must match the spatial mode of the collective radiation of the ensemble with the mode of the laser beam while minimizing the effects of decoherence due to optical pumping. For ensembles coupling to a probe field that varies over the extent of the cloud, the set of atoms that indistinguishably radiates into a desired mode of the field defines an inhomogeneous spin wave. Strong coupling of a spin wave to the probe mode is not characterized by a single parameter, the optical density, but by a collection of different effective atom numbers that characterize the coherence and decoherence of the system. To model the dynamics of the system, we develop a full stochastic master equation, including coherent collective scattering into paraxial modes, decoherence by local inhomogeneous diffuse scattering, and backaction due to continuous measurement of the light entangled with the spin waves. This formalism is used to study the squeezing of a spin wave via continuous quantum nondemolition measurement. We find that the greatest squeezing occurs in parameter regimes where spatial inhomogeneities are significant, far from the limit in which the interface is well approximated by a one-dimensional, homogeneous model.},

The second involves expanding the field in the set of plane-wave solutions of the Maxwell equations in the vacuum. The relation between the two quantization schemes is discussed in the framework of the scattering theory that connects them. The methods presented are used to show that various field components within a dielectric medium may be either superfluctuant or subfluctuant relative to their fundamental uncertainties in the vacuum. These alterations of the fluctuation properties of the fields are shown to lead to changes in the spontaneous emission rates for both electric and magnetic dipole transitions of excited atoms within or near dielectric media.
