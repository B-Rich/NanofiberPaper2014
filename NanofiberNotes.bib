@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The functions $\protect \mathbf  {g}_\eta (\protect \mathbf  {r})$ are not strictly transverse because of the spatial variation of the index of refraction, $n(r_\perp )$. These modes do, nonetheless, constitute the far-field radiated by the dipole. For further details see Refs. \cite {sakoda_optical_1996, wubs_multiple-scattering_2004} "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="In a careful derivation of the Lippman-Schwinger scattering equation, it is not the total Green's function that appears in Eq.~(\ref {Eq::ScatteredField}) but rather a related dyadic quantity, $\protect \mathbf  {K}(\protect \mathbf  {r},\protect \mathbf  {r}', \omega _0) = \protect \mathbf  {G}(\protect \mathbf  {r},\protect \mathbf  {r}', \omega _0) + \delta (\protect \mathbf  {r}-\protect \mathbf  {r}')/n^2(\protect \mathbf  {r})$ \cite {wubs_multiple-scattering_2004}. This function arises by proper accounting of the scatterer's coupling to the \protect \emph  {displacement} rather than the electric field \cite {yao_ultrahigh_2009} with a distinction that becomes important at the source point $\protect \mathbf  {r} = \protect \mathbf  {r}'$. However, for lossless dielectrics $n(\protect \mathbf  {r})$ is real and ${\protect \rm  Im}[\protect \tensor  {\protect \mathbf  {G}}(\protect \mathbf  {r}',\protect \mathbf  {r}'; \omega )] = {\protect \rm  Im}[\protect \tensor  {\protect \mathbf  {K}}(\protect \mathbf  {r}',\protect \mathbf  {r}'; \omega )]$ \cite {yao_-chip_2010}.
