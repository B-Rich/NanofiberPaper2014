\begin{abstract}
(TBD) Strong coupling between atoms and photons is a prerequisite for quantum information processing protocols ranging from quantum-limited metrology to quantum communication and computation.  This strong coupling regime can be achieved in a nanofiber platform whereby ensembles or atoms are trapped in a two-side chain through the evanescent field of a nanofiber.  In this work, we study the atom-photon interface in the dispersive regime, where the atoms' spin state is coupled to the photons' polarization through the index of refraction. We calculate this dispersive interaction through a first principles scattering model. Connections of the Green function method to a few other methods are discussed.  We calculate the dyadic Greens functions that allow and find the field scattered from the tensor-polarizable atoms. By decomposing the scattered field into guided and radiation modes, we study the phase shift and polarization rotation of the guided light along the nanofiber in presence of atoms. Compared with the free-space laser trapped atomic cloud systems, our results show that the nanofiber platform will yield strong coupling between the atoms and photons. We also analyzed the atomic state dependent phase shift and decay rates using a radiation surface model. We show the completely mixed state condition can also give a scalar polarizability effect to the phase shift. The interference effect due to a long one-sided or two-side atom chain is studied at the end of this work. This model will be used to design an efficient quantum data bus for entangling atoms with nanofiber modes.

\section{Phase shift and polarization transformation of the guided modes of a nanofiber in presence of an atom}
The light-atom interaction Hamiltonian can be defined in terms of the atomic angular momentum operator $\hat{\mathbf{F}}$ and the photonic Stokes vector operator $ \hat{\mathbf{S}}$. In general, the evolution operator can be given by
\begin{align}
\hat{U}(\tau)&=e^{i\chi \mathbin{\color{red}{\hat{\mathbf{S}}}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{F}}}.
\end{align}
For instance, if we only consider the Faraday rotation case that the Stokes operator only has the $\hat{S}_3$ component, and the initial state of the atom-light system is given by
\begin{align}
\ket{\Psi(0)} &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{\uparrow}+\ket{\downarrow})\mathbin{\color{red}{\ket{\phi_L}}}
\end{align}
where the atom is prepared in a superposition of spin up and down state, and the light in prepared in an arbitrary $\ket{\phi_L}$ state. The output after the Faraday interaction of duration $\tau$ will become
\begin{align}
\ket{\Psi(\tau)}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\ket{\uparrow}e^{+i\chi \mathbin{\color{red}{\hat{S}_3}}}\mathbin{\color{red}{\ket{\phi_L}}} 
+\ket{\downarrow}e^{-i\chi \mathbin{\color{red}{\hat{S}_3}}}\mathbin{\color{red}{\ket{\phi_L}}} \right]\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\ket{\uparrow}\mathbin{\color{red}{\ket{\phi^1_L}}} 
+\ket{\downarrow}\mathbin{\color{red}{\ket{\phi^2_L}}} \right]
\end{align}
The polarization of the light has been rotated along the $z$-axis, either $+2\chi$ or $ -2\chi$ around the $S_3$ axis on the Poincare sphere entangled with the spin state. Now the state of the joined system is in an entangled state between the spin system and the light. The entanglement between the atomic system and the light can be employed for quantum metrology and quantum information processing. 

The Faraday effect does not change the helicity of the polarized light. In general, however, the output Stokes vector $\mathbf{S}_{out}$ can be an arbitrary rotation along the three Poincare sphere axis after the atom-light interaction:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{S}_{out} &= \mathbf{S}_{in}+\mathbf{\Theta}\times\mathbf{S}_{in},
\end{align}
where the rotation angle along the $i$-axis is $\Theta_i \propto N_A\left( \frac{\sigma_0}{A}\right) \left(\frac{\Gamma}{2\Delta}\right)$ with effective atom number $N_A$, on-resonance scattering cross section $\sigma_0$, effective mode area $A$ which is inversely proportional to the mode square of the normalized electric field, atomic decay rate $\Gamma$ and the detuning $\Delta$. The rotation along the $S_1$ or $S_2$ axes yields the birefringence effect for the light. 

\textcolor{red}{Maybe a figure to show the Poincare sphere and the Faraday/birefringence effects here.}

For a given detuning and atom species, the effective atom number, $N_A$, and the optical depth per atom, $ OD=\sigma_0/A$, determines the rotation angle and hence the coupling strength between the joint systems. There have been a huge amount of efforts to enhance the atom-light interaction strength using the atom trapping configuration in free-space or vacuum~[\textcolor{red}{Refs}]. The problem for the vacuum trapping configuration is that the effective atom number $N_A$ is positively correlated with the effective mode area, and hence the total optical depth, $N_A\left( \frac{\sigma_0}{A}\right)$, is limited to some finite value around $50\sim 100$, typically with $10^6$ atoms. The nanofiber trapped atomic system, however, decouples the correlation between the effective atom number and the effective mode area. Each atom has the same amount of effective mode area, and experiences the same strength of field. Moreover, the evanescent probing field of the nanofiber where the atoms are trapped can be very strong compared to the vacuum trapping configuration due to the weak confinement of the nanofiber with a sub-wavelength diameter. With about $2000$ atoms, it is possible to achieve a total optical depth of $200$ as will be shown later. All of these factors above makes the nanofiber a promising platform for atom-light interfaces with strong coupling strength. 


In the consequent sections, we will firstly employ the Green function method to solve the semi-classical radiation and scattering problem of a two-level dipole in the evanescent field of a nanofiber. Then we will extend to the real atom in a quantized field case. The phase shift and birefringence effects will be studied in terms of orthogonal field components. For example, if the input field is diagonally linearly polarized as
\begin{align}
\mathbf{E}_{in} &= E_0(\hat{e}_x+\hat{e}_y),
\end{align}
the output field can be written as
\begin{align}
\mathbf{E}_{out} &= E_0(t_xe^{i\phi_x}\hat{e}_x+t_ye^{i\phi_y}\hat{e}_y).
\end{align}
The ratio of the attenuation coefficients, $t_x$ and $t_y$, indicates the helicity of the polarization of the light. $\phi_x$ and $\phi_y$ represent the phase shifts in the $x$- and $y$-modes. 

\subsection{Nanofiber mode scattering in presence of an atom}
\textcolor{blue}{Start from the Maxwell equation with a dipole source and the corresponding equation of the dyadic Green function. Describe the framework of solving the fiber fields in presence of an atom using the dyadic Green function method.}

\subsection{Dyadic Green functions and fiber mode decomposition}
\textcolor{blue}{Sketch out the \textit{numerical} approach to solve the dyadic Green functions through the division of reflected and transmitted parts, and how to distinguish the radiation and guided modes through separating different integral paths. Give the equivalent expression for the guided mode contribution to the dyadic Green function using the eigenmode decomposition method. Detailed solutions should be given in the appendix.} 

\subsection{Phase shift and birefringence spectroscopy}
\textcolor{blue}{The theory of phase shift for a given fiber mode and the transformation of polarization of the two orthogonal guided modes. This should include both circular and linear polarization presentations. Show that the phase shift is proportional to the $ \Gamma_{1D} $ which is defined through the imaginary part of the dyadic Green function.} 
\begin{align}
\delta\phi &= -\frac{\Gamma_{1D}^\mu}{2\Delta},\\
\frac{\Gamma_{1D}^\mu}{\Gamma_0} &= \frac{6\pi c}{\omega}\frac{\sum_g\mathbf{d}_{eg}\cdot \mathrm{Im}\left[\mathbf{G}_g^\mu(\br',\br') \right]\cdot\mathbf{d}_{eg}^* }{\sum_g|\mathbf{d}_{eg}|^2} = 1+ \frac{3}{2} \frac{\mathrm{Im}\left[\sum_g\mathbf{d}_{eg}^*\cdot \mathbf{E}^{(R,\mu)}_g(\br') \right]}{\sum_g|\mathbf{d}_{eg}|^2 k^3}\nonumber\\
&=\frac{3\pi}{2}\left(\frac{c}{\omega}\right)^2\frac{c}{v_g} \frac{\sum_{g}|\mathbf{d}_{eg}\cdot \mathbf{u}^\mu(\br')|^2}{\sum_g|\mathbf{d}_{eg}|^2}\\
\mathbf{E}^{(R,\mu)}_g(\br') &= -\frac{1}{4\pi k^2} \mathbf{G}^{(R,\mu)}_g(\br',\br')\cdot \mathbf{d}_{eg},
\end{align}
the exact version of $ \delta\phi $ may include both the difference of the laser and atomic frequencies (detuning, $ \Delta $) and the sum of them for far-detuned energy levels. The index $ R $ indicates the reflected component, and $\mu=(m,f,\beta)  $ identifies the normalized fiber mode $ \mathbf{u}^\mu(\br') $ with angular moment quantum number $ m $ and propagation index $ f $. 

\textcolor{blue}{The polarization transformation related to the real part of the dyadic Green function. There could be a polarization transformation effect for the forward or backward propagating guided modes, which has been studied in literature.} 

\subsection{Dispersive atom number measurement}

\textcolor{blue}{Discuss the homodyne detection and sensitivity to the atom number and operating frequency in the shot noise limit.  It relates to (i) the phase shift and (ii) the shot noise resolution of the polarimeter. Should cover expectation value and fluctuation measurements. Requires quantization of fields in Green function language.}

\subsection{Effects of the evanescent field and the multilevel structure of the atom}
In general, 
\begin{align}
\Gamma \propto \mathbf{d}_{eg}\cdot \mathrm{Im}\left[\mathbf{G}(\br',\br') \right]\cdot\mathbf{d}_{eg}^*=\mathrm{tr}\left[\mathbf{d}_{eg}^*\mathbf{d}_{eg}\cdot \mathrm{Im}\left[\mathbf{G}(\br',\br') \right] \right]\propto \mathrm{tr}\left[\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{eg}\cdot \mathrm{Im}\left[\mathbf{G}(\br',\br') \right] \right]
\end{align}
where $ \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{eg} $ is the polarizability of the atom due to the transition between levels labeled by $ eg $. Therefore, the phase shift effect can be treated as a combination effect of the atomic internal structure and the external field properties. 

Since 
\begin{align}
\mathbf{d}_{eg}\cdot \mathrm{Im}\left[\mathbf{G}(\br',\br') \right]\cdot\mathbf{d}_{eg}^*>0
\end{align}
for a physical decay rate, $\mathrm{Im}\left[\mathbf{G}(\br',\br')\right]$ is positive definite and should always has three positive eigenvalues which indicate the range of $ \Gamma $ and phase shift at the atom position. The 3 corresponding eigenvectors indicate the 3 orthogonal principal axes of the radiation/emission surface. Case studies...

Radiation surface theory for the effective orientation of dipoles, elementary transitions ($ \pi $ and $ \sigma_\pm $ transitions) and the example of completely mixed state case. 
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{mix} &\propto \frac{1}{3} \mathrm{tr}\left[ \mathrm{Im}\left[\mathbf{G}(\br',\br')\right] \right].
\end{align}

For the atomic internal structure, we have the irreducible tensor decompositions that 
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{eg} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}^S + \boldsymbol{\alpha}^V + \boldsymbol{\alpha}^T.
\end{align}
The scalar component will yield a decay rate equivalent to the completely mixed state case. 

Another way to look at this problem is that we can decompose the guided mode Green function tensor into the scalar, vector and tensor parts as well, since it is irreducible.
\begin{align}
\mathbf{G}^g=\mathbf{G}^S+\mathbf{G}^V+\mathbf{G}^T.
\end{align}
Therefore, where the position of the atom relative to the fiber mode yields a strong scalar component, the atomic response is more independent of the atom state... 

Some interesting examples of state-dependent decay and phase shift...



\subsection{Interference due to a one-sided or two-sided atom chain}
Effect of an infinite long one-side chain... S matrix, reflectivity... Random filling effect...

Effect of the two-side chain:

The symmetry or antisymmetry nature (TBD) of the radiation surface at the opposite sides along the $ r\!_\perp $ axis will yield a constructive/destructive interference of the two-side chain.
